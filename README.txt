Hello lovely downloader of this project! This is a GUI-Based RPG that was made
for the final of a college Intro to Programming class.

To run the program, simply double click "turn_based.py" and it'll run. Otherwise,
you can open the same file and run the "main()" function in there, as that's where
everything is initialized.

SOME THINGS TO KNOW!
Json- This game runs on .json files- you can edit the area, enemy, and weapon data
in these files and it'll get changed in the game! You can also add your own
weapons, enemies, shop items, and areas. Everything that is possible is used,
so look to the rest of the existing json as an example

PLAYING
there are buttons that you can click and you can hover over certain places to get
extra information
Hovering over the enemy's name will display their health, damage, defense, and any
    elemental damage they may deal
If an enemy's name is red, that means they are still taking elemental damage from
    one of your previous attacks
Health, defense, etc get reset between encounters
The above is NOT true if you flee the battle, in which you will retain your health
    but will not get the coins from the battle
Special items are key! You should try to get them as much as possible.
Potions unlock after beating area 3. These heal you for 40 health as an action in
    battle

and that's it! Thanks for downloading.
